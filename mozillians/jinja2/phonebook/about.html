        <p>
          Mozillians are people who volunteer their time to advance the Mozilla
          mission. They're dedicated to promoting openness, innovation and
          opportunity on the Web and they form the core of our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          This directory is a resource to make it easy for Mozillians to learn
          who is involved, what they do and how to connect with them. It also
          allows you to receive email communications from Mozilla.

          Privacy has been an important part of this directory from the very
          beginning. We want to make sure we provide Mozillians with the best
          experience possible, from the way the site is built to the way we
          vouch for new users before they can access data that should only be
          available to other Mozillians. Read our
